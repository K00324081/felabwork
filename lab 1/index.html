        <h1>WHY WE SHOULD PROTECT THE ENVIROMENT</h1>
      
        <p>
          We should protect the environment because it's essential for human health, providing clean air, water, and food, and a healthy ecosystem supports biodiversity. Protecting nature is also crucial for combating climate change, preserving resources for future generations, and maintaining the Earth's overall stability. A healthy environment ensures well-being, supports economies, and upholds the intrinsic value of nature.
